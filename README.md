## State Management with Riverpod
To efficiently manage the state of the application, BetEbet utilizes Riverpod, a state management library for Flutter. Riverpod offers a more robust and flexible way to handle state compared to traditional methods like Bloc. Hereâ€™s an overview of how Riverpod is integrated into BetEbet:

## Benefits of Using Riverpod
Simplified State Management: Riverpod simplifies the process of managing state in a Flutter application, making it easier to read and maintain.
Improved Performance: With Riverpod, state is only rebuilt when necessary, improving the performance of the app.
Increased Flexibility: Riverpod provides more flexibility for handling complex state management scenarios.
Implementation
Providers: Riverpod uses providers to manage the state. Different types of providers (e.g., Provider, StateProvider, FutureProvider, StreamProvider) are used based on the requirements.
Scoped State: State can be scoped to different parts of the widget tree, ensuring that only the necessary parts of the UI are rebuilt.
Dependency Injection: Riverpod makes it easy to manage dependencies and inject them where needed.
